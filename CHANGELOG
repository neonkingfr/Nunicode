1.6

[+] Unicode 8.0.0 character set support
[+] implemented contractions in DUCET-based collation of
    strings, affected functions: nu_strcoll(), nu_strncoll(),
    nu_strcasecoll(), nu_strcasencoll(), nu_strstr(), nu_strnstr(),
    nu_strcasestr(), nu_strcasenstr()

    e.g.: nu_strcoll(U+013F, U+004C U+00B7) equals 0 (according to DUCET)
    see: https://bitbucket.org/alekseyt/nunicode#markdown-header-strings-collation

[*] SQLite3 extension renamed from "nunicode" to "nusqlite3",
    affected files: sqlite3/nu.c -> sqlite3/nusqlite3.c,
                    sqlite3/nu.h -> sqlite3/nusqlite3.h
    build: "make nunicode" -> "make nusqlite3"
    library: libnunicode.so -> libnusqlite3.so
[*] SQLite3 collations NU700 and NU700_NOCASE replaced with
    NU800 and NU800_NOCASE
[*] build scripts need at least CMake 2.8.12
[*] ``install`` target  will install CMake config-module 
    ``nunicode-config.cmake`` which creates the import library
    ``nunicode::nu``, usage:

    find_package(nunicode REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(*<some-target>* nunicode::nu)

    (by Tamas Kenez)

[*] optional build of unittests: see BUILD
[*] optional build of sample applications: see BUILD

1.5.2

[+] introduced nu_casemap_read and nu_udb_read as a replacement
    for NU_CASEMAP_DECODING_FUNCTION and NU_UDB_DECODING_FUNCTION
    accordingly. NU_*_FUNCTION macros are still available, but
    not recommended for use

[*] mph.h: hash() renamed to _nu_hash(), mph_hash() renamed to
    nu_mph_hash(), mph_lookup() renamed to nu_mph_lookup()
[*] changes to make nunicode build with MSVC (by Tamas Kenez)
[*] fixed test: test_readstr, which contained a UTF-16BE string literal
    with a single byte zero-terminator (by Tamas Kenez)
[*] fixed tests: test_utf16le_decoding, test_utf16he_decoding, which
    contained string literals with a single byte zero-terminator
[*] fixed assertions in tests: test_utf32_read_bom,
    test_utf32_read_invalid_bom, which tested value at memory preceding
    the actual test string (by Tamas Kenez)
[*] fixed CMake 3.3 warnings during build (by Tamas Kenez)
[*] SQLite3 detection during build configuration will look
    for availability of sqlite3ext.h instead of sqlite3.h
[*] minor documentation updates
[*] minor updates for readability

1.5.1

[+] introduced nu_version() fuction complementary to NU_VERSION define
    in headers
[+] introduced _nu_tolower(), _nu_toupper(), _nu_tofold() for conditional
    case mapping and folding
[+] introduced _nu_transform_read_t for simultaneous string decoding
    and transformation
[+] introduced _nu_strtransformlen() complementary to _nu_transform_read_t

[*] fixed bug when trailing U+0000 might not have been detected correctly
    in big-endian encodings, affected functions: (extra) nu_transformstr(),
    nu_transformnstr(), nu_readstr(), nu_readnstr(); (strings) nu_strlen(),
    nu_strnlen()
[*] nu_utf32be_write() and nu_utf32le_write() will skip actual writing
    to memory if pointer to output is 0/NULL (in confrormance to all other
    encoding functions)
[*] documentation updates

1.5

[+] conformant UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 validation

[*] documentation updates (wording)
[*] fixed broken links in doc

1.4

[+] Unicode conformant case folding
[+] introduced nu_tofold()
[+] new build option: NU_WITH_TOFOLD
[+] new build option: NU_BUILD_STATIC
[+] new build option: NU_DISABLE_CONTRACTIONS

[*] nu_ducet_weight() will sort codepoints with undefined weights
    in codepoint order, after codepoints with defined weights
[*] performance improvements

For performance reasons several API changes were made:

[*] nu_toupper(), nu_tolower(), nu_udb_lookup() are no longer
    accept output argument for output decoding function.

    Instead there are two defines provided:
      NU_CASEMAP_DECODING_FUNCTION (nu_utf8_read)
      NU_UDB_DECODING_FUNCTION (nu_utf8_read)

    Those are for use on return values of corresponding unctions

[*] accordingly to previous, nu_transformation_t and nu_casemapping_t
    types are no longer accept output argument for output decoding
    function
[*] nu_strtransformlen() is now accepting extra argument - transformation
    output decoding function

[*] SQLite3 extension updated to follow new folding method
[*] documentation updated to outline internal API functions
[*] faster UTF-8 and UTF-16 decoding
[*] all UTF decoding functions are marked for inlining
[*] GCC: visibility defaults to "hidden" for all functions if
    NU_BUILD_STATIC is defined

    case-sensitive collation
[+] introduced COLLATE NU630_NOCASE to SQLite extension - Unicode 6.3.0
    case-insensitive collation

[-] removed deprecated sqlite3_extension_init() in favor
    of sqlite3_nunicode_init()

[*] COLLATE NUNICODE is removed in favor of COLLATE NU630
[*] COLLATE NOCASE is removed in favor of COLLATE NU630_NOCASE

1.2

[*] nu's sqlite3_extension_init() is now deprecated in
    favor of sqlite3_nunicode_init()
[*] renamed nunicode_sqlite3_init() into
    nunicode_sqlite3_static_init()

    complexity of collation

    functions
